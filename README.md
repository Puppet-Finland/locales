locales
=======

A Puppet module for managing operating system locales

# Module usage

* [Class: locales](manifests/init.pp)

# Dependencies

See [metadata.json](metadata.json).

# Operating system support

This module has been tested on

* Ubuntu 12.04-14.04
* Debian 7

Other Debian/Ubuntu variants should work with small modifications. Adding 
support for RedHat derivatives would probably be slightly more challenging.

For details see [params.pp](manifests/params.pp).
